<h2>What's in the box?</h2>
<p>
After cloning the repository into <span class="code">$HOME/workspace</span> and running the <span class="code">setup</span>, you have a directory structure like this:
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
$HOME
  |
  +-- bin/
  |     |
  |     +-- authserver (start/stop the credit authorization server)
  |     |
  |     +-- store (start/stop the Point of Sale Store application) 
  |     |
  |     +-- register (start a Point of Sale Register instance)
  |
  +-- Desktop/
  |     |
  |     +-- Point-of-Sale-Docs
  |
  +-- workspace
        |
        +-- point-of-sale/
              |
              +-- install
              |
              +-- pom.xml
              |
              +-- (typical Eclipse/Maven directory structure)
              |
              +-- credit-authorization/
                    |
                    +-- app/
                         |
                         +---- authserver.rb
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The project is already set up as a <span class="code">git</span> project with the root at <span class="code">point-of-sale</span>. Eclipse is already configured with <span class="code">git</span> support, so you can issue version control commands from within Eclipse or from the command line, as you prefer.

<h2>What's it about?</h2>
<p>
The retail point of sale application is designed help you practice software development techniques in Java. Some of the functionality has already been implemented. Some of the provided code illustrates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smells</a> we often encounter in production code in the wild, presenting you with an opportunity to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">improve the design</a> as you add new functionality.
</p>
<p>
The descriptions of the new functionality you will add to the application are provided in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user stories</a>, a popular format for describing the desired behavior of software. As you play the stories (that is, implement the functionality), you will discover various opportunities to practice <a href="http://xprogramming.com/classics/expemergentdesign/">emergent design</a> and to explore the implications of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_Priority_Premise">code transformations</a> you choose as you grow the solution via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a>.
</p>
<a name="context"/>
<h2>Some context for development</h2>
<p>
If this were a &quot;real&quot; software development project, there would be some degree of up-front analysis and design. With traditional development processes, a comprehensive design would be prepared before beginning coding. With adaptive processes, enough design would be completed ahead of time to give people confidence they were taking the solution in the right direction, and they had a good general idea of the architecture. We take the latter approach here.
</p>
<p>
Here is a context diagram that shows the application you will be working on. You will modify some or all of the blue components as you play User Stories during the course. The credit authorization server is provided so that you will have to deal with an external dependency; you need not modify it. 
</p>
<p>
The Store application is a multithreaded server. The Register application simulates the point of sale terminals and peripheral devices. The database is MongoDB.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>
The point of sale system has seven broad areas of functionality and three main actors. Here is a Use Case Diagram to give you an idea of the general types of user interactions the system may support.
</p>
<img src="images/point-of-sale-use-case-diagram.png" width="500px"/>
</p>
<p>
<a name="storymap"/>
<h2>Story Map</h2>
</p>
<p>
A typical lightweight and collaborative analysis technique is to write the desired features (tasks) on cards or sticky notes and arrange them under each broad functional area (activity) until the team and stakeholders agree the most important ones are lined up along the top. The technique is called <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_new_backlog.html">story mapping</a>. Here is a story map showing the main features to be developed for the point of sale application.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/point-of-sale-story-map.png" width="1000px"/>
</p>
<a name="walkingskeleton"/>
<h2>Walking Skeleton</h2>
<p>
Once the story map has been organized properly, we can see which features ought to be addressed first in order to deliver the highest possible value to stakeholders in the shortest time. If we group the tasks horizontally across the top row of the map, we have the functionality that will provide a working system that has the most critical features in place. This initial implementation is sometimes called a <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Walking+skeleton">walking skeleton</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/point-of-sale-walking-skeleton.png" width="1000px"/>
</p>
<p>
The walking skeleton represents a minimal set of features that is usable and valuable to customers. It provides a way to deliver something of value early, before all planned features have been implemented.
</p>
<p>
A closely-related idea is the notion of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a> (MVP). This is a minimal implementation that can be put into production to gauge the response of users. Based on feedback from users, we can tweak the design to meet their needs better. The idea comes from the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Startup</a> concept, in which an initial solution is put into the market quickly in order to get feedback from real customers to guide further development of the product.
</p>
<h2>User Types and Personas</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories">User Stories</a> generally represent the interaction between a person and an application. They describe an interaction from the point of view of the user.
</p>
<p>
A <em>user type</em> or <em>actor</em> represents a category of user who interacts with the application in particular ways, based on the tasks they need to perform to carry out the responsibilities of their job. Typically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between user types and permissions, or <a href="https://protect.iu.edu/cybersecurity/authn-authz">authorization</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Some User Stories deal with interactions that are the same for everyone who is of the same user type. For example, we might write a User Story that describes an interaction between <em>cashiers</em> and the Point of Sale application like this:
</p>
<pre class="code box">
As a cashier,
I need to sign in to my register
So that I can accept payment from customers
</pre>
<p>
It doesn't matter who the cashier is, how they prefer to do their job, or whether they have any physical limitations that affect the way they work; all cashiers sign in in the same way.
</p>
<p>
Other User Stories describe interactions that differ by individual, even if the individuals are all of the same user type. For example, one customer might prefer to pay cash, another might prefer to use a debit card, another might use Food Stamps, and another might pay by redeeming loyalty points.
</p>
<p>
To distinguish individual differences like these, we use <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/personas.htm">Personas</a>. A persona is a made-up person who has a backstory, a reason to patronize the store, and preferences about how they want to shop and pay for purchases. Personas help us fine-tune our design to ensure a positive <a href="http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions">user experience</a> for the people who will depend on our software.
</p>
<p>
To help make the User Stories meaningful, we have defined several User Types and Personas for the Point of Sale application. The details are documented separately, but here is an overview:
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/point-of-sale-user-types-and-personas.png" width="1000px"/>
</p>
<p>
So, we might write a User Story for Alexei, another one for Larissa, and another for Lenny:
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As Alexei,
I need the store to accept Food Stamps
So that I can purchase basic necessities
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As Larissa,
I need the store to keep plenty of candy in stock
So that I can buy candy on the way home from school every day
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As Lenny,
I need someone to approve alcohol sales
So that I can buy booze when Dan is working the register
</pre>
</p>
