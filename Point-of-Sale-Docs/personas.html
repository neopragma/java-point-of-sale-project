<h3>Alexei Yevtushenko</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/alexei-yevtushenko.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Since coming to the US from his native Ukraine some 15 years ago, Alexei has had difficulty adjusting to life in his adopted country. He had not planned on immigrating, and had left precipitously due to political issues, with the expectation he would soon return. To this day he cannot let go of the idea that he will return to Ukraine and resume his former life there. He had steady employment in Ukraine as a licensed electrician, but has not obtained a license in the US. He has worked odd jobs off and on, but has never held a job for more than 3 or 4 weeks. At first he attributed this to the language barrier, but as he gradually overcame that obstacle he continued to have difficulty holding a job. At 60 years of age, jobs are becoming harder to come by and Alexei does not always have a place to sleep at night. He shops at the store almost every day. He purchases small quantities of ready-to-eat packaged food items and prepared hot foods. He pays for his purchases using a combination of food stamps and cash, with the cash consisting of a few crumpled low-denomination notes and a relatively large quantity of coins.

<h3>Larissa Jagendorf</h3>

</p>
<p>
Ten-year-old Larissa lives with her parents and sister in an apartment just half a block from the store, above the same row of storefronts where the store is located. She grew up in the neighborhood and has lived in the same apartment her whole life. She has a sweet tooth, and tries to save part of her lunch money every day so that she can buy snacks at the store on her way home from school. Sometimes, when Alexei is in the store at the same time as Larissa and he doesn't have enough money for his purchase, she will pay the difference and forego all or part of her snack for the day. Larissa knows the names of all the employees and always greets them cheerfully.

<h3>James Crusoe</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
James is a go-getter, an up-and-coming financial analyst who is laying the groundwork for a well-planned career. He shares an apartment not far from the store with a couple of roommates who are also young professionals on an upward track. They are living in this neighborhood to keep their expenses low while they build up their nest eggs. James stops by for his morning coffee on the way to the subway station, and again on the way home to grab a prepared sandwich and a soft drink for dinner. He is always in a hurry and wants his credit card purchases to be processed without delay. He generally does not notice the other customers in the store, and doesn't look at the cashier when making purchases.

<h3>Lenny Rader</h3>

</p>
<p>
Lenny is a friendly but unambitious type who works at the pawn shop across the street from the store. He shops at the store two or three times per week, and he is usually in the market for liquor and cigarettes. 
</p>

<h3>Ayinde Salafia</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/ayinde-salafia.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Ayinde is careful with his money. A few years ago he overextended himself, accepting too many credit card offers from overzealous financial companies and getting in over his head with debt. During the long process of paying down the debt, Ayinde got into the habit of buying only what he could pay for, and avoiding the careless use of credit. When he shops at the store he prefers to pay by debit card.  
</p>

<h3>Dan Pankow</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/dan-pankow.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Dan started working at the store last summer when he was looking for temporary work until school started up again in the fall. When fall came, Dan decided to continue working part-time at the store while attending school. Although he's too young to sell alcohol and tobacco, he has become the best cashier Marilyn has on staff. Dan doesn't intend to make his career in retail sales. He sees the job as a way to make a bit of money to help pay for school. Once he earns his degree he will move on. In the meantime, he doesn't object to the work and he likes the people he works with.
</p>

<h3>Bonnie Preston</h3>

</p>
<p>
A single parent who takes her responsibilities seriously, Bonnie is a reliable, long-term employee. Her native language is French, and she appreciates the fact her register system can work in French. Bonnie is gregarious and interested in everyone. She enjoys her job as a cashier because it enables her to meet and talk to many different people throughout the day. 
</p>

<h3>Vicente Esposito</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/vicente-esposito.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Vicente is a young man with a plan. His job as a stocker is the first real full-time job he has had, and he sees it as an opportunity to learn everything he can about the business. He is diligent in doing his present job, but also very interested in learning all aspects of the store's operation. He often helps Marilyn with the bookkeeping, and he hopes to become a store manager before too long, and a regional manager after that. Eventually he would like to own a franchise business himself. He is amiable and outgoing with customers and co-workers.
</p>

<h3>Chantal Austin</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/chantal-austin.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Chantal has been a stocker since the store opened. She has never requested a raise, a promotion, or any change in status or responsibilities. She is a quiet, reserved person who tends not to engage in conversation beyond greetings and farewells. She likes her job because it doesn't require her to interact much with other people, and because it is easy work. Although she has worked in the store a long time, her co-workers don't know her well, and that's fine with her. 
</p>

<h3>Marilyn Davis</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/marilyn-davis.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Marilyn is a 50-something mother of four who was becoming bored with staying at home after her children had grown up. She joined the company and took the management course a few years ago, and found she had great aptitude for running a retail store operation. For her, the employees are like a second family to take care of. Marilyn likes working with numbers and she finds the accounting tasks some of the more enjoyable aspects of the job. She has a strong focus on customer satisfaction and on earning repeat business from regulars. She is very interested in knowing what types of products her customers want, and the shopping experience her customers have.
