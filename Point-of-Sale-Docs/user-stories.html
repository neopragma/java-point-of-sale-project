<h1>Point of Sale Project User Stories</h1>

<p>
This document summarizes the <a href="about-user-stories.html">User Stories</a> for the class project. 
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the <a href="overview.html#storymap">Story Map</a> in the <a href="overview.html">project info</a> document. In <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_new_backlog.html">Story Mapping</a> terms, the <em>activities</em> across the top of the Story Map represent the broad functional areas of the application. The <em>tasks</em> translate into lightweight requirements artifacts such as &quot;Epics&quot; and &quot;User Stories.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
The tasks are organized on the Story Map from high to low importance for customer-defined value. Within each activity, the priority is indicated by the top-to-bottom order of the cards. By cutting horizontally across the top row of tasks, we can carve out the pieces of functionality the customer deems most important. This gives us a starting point for our first release.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="overview.html#walkingskeleton">Walking Skeleton</a> highlights the top row of activities from the Story Map. This may represent a <a href="http://practicetrumpstheory.com/minimum-viable-product/">minimum viable product</a> (MVP) from the customer's point of view. 
</p>
<p>
Lightweight development methods usually describe the requirements for a system as a list of things to do. The list may be called a Master Story List, Product Backlog, Work Queue, or something else. In any case, it is a prioritized list of work items to be completed. Here is an initial Product Backlog for our Point of Sale development project, based on the Story Map. Our first release comprises the tasks in the Walking Skeleton.
</p>
<p>
Notice that the tasks in the Story Map are high-level work items. We need to decompose them a bit to create User Stories that follow the INVEST principles. We'll use the term Epic to describe a high level task, and the term Story to describe a more fine-grained task.
</p>

<h2>Release 1</h2>

<p>
For the Transact Sales activity, at a minimum we need to be able to open a register, accept cash payment for goods, print receipts, and close the register. That is the most minimal functionality that will enable us to open for business.
</p>
<p>
We also need some of the functionality in the supporting activities. Under Manage Stock, we need to be able to add products to inventory. We can worry about other tasks in this area later. Under Manage Employees, we need to be able to tell the system about employees so that they can perform secure functions. Under Support Customers, we need to be able to handle returns, or we risk alienating customers; and word of mouth will spread quickly. Under Accounting, we must report and pay taxes or we will be out of business quite soon.
</p>

<h3>Epic 1: Open Register</h3>
<p>
A Cashier is authorized to open and close Registers. The Cashier signs into the Register application using the Employee Id. The Cashier counts the cash in the cash drawer and enters the amount. The Register connects to the Store system and compares the amount entered by the Cashier with the amount recorded from the last time the Register was closed. If the amounts match, the Register is open for business. If the amounts don't match, human intervention is required to reconcile the amounts. Once that is done, the Manager enters his/her Employee Id to indicate the Register can be opened for business.
