<h1>Point of Sale Project User Stories</h1>

<p>
This document summarizes the <a href="about-user-stories.html">User Stories</a> for the class project. 
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the <a href="overview.html#storymap">Story Map</a> in the <a href="overview.html">project info</a> document. In <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_new_backlog.html">Story Mapping</a> terms, the <em>activities</em> across the top of the Story Map represent the broad functional areas of the application. The <em>tasks</em> translate into lightweight requirements artifacts such as &quot;Epics&quot; and &quot;User Stories.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
The tasks are organized on the Story Map from high to low importance for customer-defined value. Within each activity, the priority is indicated by the top-to-bottom order of the cards. By cutting horizontally across the top row of tasks, we can carve out the pieces of functionality the customer deems most important. This gives us a starting point for our first release.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="overview.html#walkingskeleton">Walking Skeleton</a> highlights the top row of activities from the Story Map. This may represent a <a href="http://practicetrumpstheory.com/minimum-viable-product/">minimum viable product</a> (MVP) from the customer's point of view. 
</p>
<p>
Lightweight development methods usually describe the requirements for a system as a list of things to do. The list may be called a Master Story List, Product Backlog, Work Queue, or something else. In any case, it is a prioritized list of work items to be completed. Here is an initial Product Backlog for our Point of Sale development project, based on the Story Map. Our first release comprises the tasks in the Walking Skeleton.
</p>
<p>
Notice that the tasks in the Story Map are high-level work items. We need to decompose them a bit to create User Stories that follow the INVEST principles. We'll use the term Epic to describe a high level task, and the term Story to describe a more fine-grained task.
</p>

<h2>Release 1</h2>

<p>
For the Transact Sales activity, at a minimum we need to be able to open a register, accept cash payment for goods, print receipts, and close the register. That is the most minimal functionality that will enable us to open for business.
</p>
<p>
We also need some of the functionality in the supporting activities. Under Manage Stock, we need to be able to add products to inventory. We can worry about other tasks in this area later. Under Manage Employees, we need to be able to tell the system about employees so that they can perform secure functions. Under Support Customers, we need to be able to handle returns, or we risk alienating customers; and word of mouth will spread quickly. Under Accounting, we must report and pay taxes or we will be out of business quite soon.
</p>

<h3>Epic 1: Open Register</h3>
<p>
A Cashier is authorized to open and close Registers. The Cashier signs into the Register application using the Employee Id. The Cashier counts the cash in the cash drawer and enters the amount. The Register connects to the Store system and compares the amount entered by the Cashier with the amount recorded from the last time the Register was closed. If the amounts match, the Register is open for business. If the amounts don't match, human intervention is required to reconcile the amounts. Once that is done, the Manager enters his/her Employee Id to indicate the Register can be opened for business.
</p>

</pre>
</p>
<h3>Story 1.2: Open Register - No Connection to Store System</h3>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As a Cashier,
I want the Register to tell me when it can't connect to the Store system
So that I can take appropriate action

</pre>
</p>
<h3>Story 1.3: Open Register - Cash Drawer Not Reconciled</h3>
<p>

So that other people will not be able to take cash from the Dash Drawers

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am not an authorized Cashier

AND Register 3 is already open
WHEN I open Register 3
THEN the Register informs me it is already in use
AND the Register does not open for business
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Additional notes:
</p>
<p>
This is a bit of a &quot;technical story&quot; in that it's unlikely a person would imagine 
the POS system could possibly think there were two of the same physical Register in the universe. 
However, the Store software can be made to connect with two clients that both identify themselves 
as the same Register, unless we explicitly prevent it. The Cashier is the actor who obtains value 
from this story, as he/she is responsible for the cash in the Register and the credit and debit 
card transactions handled through the Register.
</p>
<h3>Story 1.7: Open Register When In Closed-Pending State and In Balance</h3>
<p>
Not for Release 1. When a Register closes in closed-pending state, it means the Register was unable to report its closing Cash Drawer amount to the Store system at the time it was closed. The Open Register operation has to complete the process of comparing entered and calculated ending Cash Drawer amounts.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As a Cashier,
When I open a Register that was closed in Closed-Pending state,
I want the system to balance the Cash Drawer amounts
So that I will have a clean start for my shift.

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am an authorized Cashier
AND the register was closed in Close-Pending state
AND the entered Cash Drawer amount equals the calculated Cash Drawer amount
THEN Register 4 reports its closing Cash Drawer amount
AND Register 4 opens for business
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Story 1.8: Open Register When In Closed-Pending State and Out of Balance</h3>
<p>
Not for Release 1.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As a Cashier,
When I open a Register that was closed in Closed-Pending state
and the Cash Drawer counts are different,
I want the system to balance the Cash Drawer amounts
So that I will have a clean start for my shift.

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am an authorized Cashier
AND the register was closed in Close-Pending state
AND the calculated Cash Drawer amount is $3,450.00
AND the Cashier enters the amount $3,400.00
THEN Register 4 goes into unreconciled state
AND Register 4 informs the Cashier that Manager action is required
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Story 1.9: Open Register After Manager Signs Off on Cash Drawer Balance</h3>
<p>
Not for Release 1.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As a Manager,
I want to verify each Register was closed with the correct amount in the Cash Drawer
before allowing the Register to open for a new shift
So that I can prevent theft and account for funds properly

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN Register 5 is opened in closed-pending state
AND the entered and calculated Cash Drawer amounts are different
AND Manager has verified the correct Cash Drawer amount
WHEN Manager approves the Register as in balance
THEN the system stores the closing Cash Drawer amount
AND Register 5 opens for business
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Epic 2: Close Register</h3>
<p>
When a Cashier closes the Register, the following things happen:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Cashier counts the money in the Cash Drawer and enters the amount into the system.</li>
<li>System has calculated the expected Cash Drawer balance as transactions were carried out. It now compares the calculated amount with the entered amount.</li>
<li>If the amounts are the same, the Register sends its status information to the Store system where it is saved.</li>
<li>The Cashier is signed out and the Register is closed for business.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
If the amounts are not the same, human intervention is required to reconcile the amounts. Once that has been done, the Manager enters a code to tell the system the amounts are in balance and the Register can be closed.
</p>
<h3>Story 2.1: Close Register - Happy Path</h3>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
As a Cashier,
I want to close my Register
So that I can end my shift

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN Cashier is signed into Register 4

THEN Register 4 reports its closing Cash Drawer amount
AND Register 4 closes for business
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Story 2.2: Close Register - Cash Drawer Unreconciled</h3>

<pre class="code box">
As a Cashier,
I want help balancing my Cash Drawer
So that I can close my Register
and end my shift

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN Cashier attempts to close Register 3
AND the calculated Cash Drawer amount is $3,450.00
AND the Cashier enters the amount $3,400.00

AND Register 5 closes for business
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Story 2.4: Close Register - Lost Connection to Store System</h3>
<p>
This story is not included in Release 1. This is a &quot;technical story&quot; in that a business person is unlikely to think of the scenario when the connection to the Store system is lost before or during the Register close operation.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code box">
Given I am a Cashier,
I want the Register to handle lost connections gracefully when closing
So that I can end my shift

</pre>
</p>
<h3>Epic 3: Accept Cash Payment</h3>
<p>
A Register has to be able to support cash payments for purchases. The Cashier opens the Cash Drawer, accepts the cash from the Customer, and counts out change from the Cash Drawer. The Register system deducts the sale amount from the running Cash Drawer balance.
